	<h1>UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO AT SCRABOROUGH: <strong>INFORMED CONSENT STATEMENT</strong></h1>

	<h1>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Dr. Michael Inzlicht, Professor</h1>

	<h1>PROJECT: Cognitive performance and exercise</h1>


	<h2>INFORMATION</h2>

		<p>You are invited to participate in a research study. The purpose of this study is to examine the relation between cognitive performance and physical activity. During this study, you will complete a computer task in which you will be asked to respond to words presented on a computer screen, complete a series of brief questionnaires about your experience within the task, as well as more general questions about yourself (e.g., personality, demographics). You will also be asked to engage in physical activity. Although the research cannot be fully explained at this time, a complete explanation will be provided at the conclusion of your participation.</p>

		<p>This study will take place in one session that will take approximately 18 minutes in total. If you complete the session, you will receive $2.20 for your participation plus any additional money you earn through your performance.</p>


	<h2>RISKS</h2>

		<p>Although there are no foreseeable risks involved in participating in this study, some people find physically exerting themselves to be uncomfortable (e.g., raised heart-rate, sweating, being out of breath, muscle soreness). If you experience discomfort or pain that is beyond what you are comfortable with at any time during the experimental procedure, please inform the experimenters right away.</p>

	<h2>BENEFITS</h2>

		<p>You will have the opportunity to observe the methods that researchers use to study the factors related to peopleâ€™s cognitive performance, thus enhancing your understanding of psychological research methods. By participating you will also contribute to the body of knowledge about cognition and exercise.</p>


	<h2>CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>

		<p>Your responses will be kept completely confidential: Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained by assigning all the data you provide a code number. Your confidential data will be kept on a secure, password-protected server that can be accessed only by the research supervisor and authorized researchers and will be destroyed seven years after the completion of this study, in accordance with American Psychological Association guidelines. The results of this study may be reported in conference presentations and journal articles.  Note, however, that the responses of individual participants will not be identified in any reports of this research; only aggregated data (e.g., averages from the projected 400 participants) will be reported.</p>


	<h2>COMPENSATION</h2>

		<p>Participants will receive $2.20 plus any additional money they earn through their performance.  Participants who begin the study but choose to withdraw prior to its completion or ask to have their questionnaire responses deleted will not receive financial compensation. Of course, once your completed questionnaire has been submitted, it cannot be withdrawn because it is anonymous.</p>


	<h2>CONTACT</h2>

		<p>If you have questions at any time about the study or the procedures, you may contact the principle researcher, Dr. Michael Inzlicht, at the Department of Psychology, University of Toronto, Scarborough Campus, email: michael.inzlicht@utoronto.ca . This project has been reviewed and approved by the University Research Ethics Board. If you feel you have not been treated according to the descriptions in this form, or your rights as a participant in research have been violated during the course of this project, you may contact the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board, ethics.review@utoronto.ca.</p>


	<h2>PARTICIPATION</h2>
